This is a [Plasmo extension](https://docs.plasmo.com/) project bootstrapped with [`plasmo init`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plasmo).

## Getting Started

To build the extension in your local machine, run

```
yarn run build
```

From here you can install the extension to your browser using the built artifact.

The extension's popup has a very simple UI that consists of 2 buttons.
- `Disemvowel`: clicking on this button will remove all the vowels in the textual content of the page in the currently active tab
- `Reset`: clicking on this button will reset the textual content back to its original state.
